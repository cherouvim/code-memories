# old-shit
Old programs I wrote around 1990-1996. My favourite resolution was of course [mode 13h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h) (320x200 with 256 colors). I screengrabed them with [ScreenToGif](http://www.screentogif.com/) running on [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/).

Unfortunatelly I don't have any of the code I wrote in 1989 on an [Amstrad 6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC6128).
